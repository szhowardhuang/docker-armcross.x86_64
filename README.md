# docker-armcross.x86_64

make cross compile dockerfile for ARM board, host is x86_64 ubuntu bionic(18.04)
you need modify your APT source file firstly & put the file into the current directory

i want to make cross compile docker image on linux VM, it can help me to mantain pure x86_64 build system on host(linux VM)

then i want to upload image to host(win10) by docker registry on host. if it is work, host(win10) for study & entertainment & file server.
linux VM focus on work , cross docker for compile.
